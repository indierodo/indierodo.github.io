[{"content":" You have to learn to take it easy on yourself. I know, like, eight million people have told you that already, but hear me out.\n\u0026ndash; Mark Manson\nEight million people and one, if you count that time I read it on \u0026ldquo;The Pragmatic Programmer\u0026rdquo;. Eight million and two, when I read it in \u0026ldquo;The Humble Programmer\u0026rdquo;. But here I am, \u0026ldquo;The Perfectionist Programmer\u0026rdquo;, thinking good-enough software sucks, and perfect software does exist somewhere in the universe, and even worse, I\u0026rsquo;ll be the one to write it.\nI fell in love with programming in the early 2010s, typing away simple programs that would compile on the first try (after all, I was copying them from the book), and I believed the rest of my journey as a developer would be filled with joy.\nI learned alone that programming was logical and pure, and that every problem had a straightforward perfect solution.\nSo then, filled with confidence, after having studied for so long, I start coding my newest invention. I fill it with cool features and embrace the task with the mastery of years of programming\u0026hellip; and after the first strike of motivation passes\u0026hellip; Turns out I cannot get it done.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s not a lack of ability or a lack of time. Rather, it\u0026rsquo;s a lack of self-awareness that cause me to fail to deliver this project, to date.\nTurns out I flew too close to the sun with this one. My vision was too ambitious. I didn\u0026rsquo;t approach the task with humility and tried to create the most perfect, amazing thing I had ever done.\nI ended up building the application three times, with different technologies. I rewrote the Software Requirements Sheet, prototyped over and over, burnt out, and didn\u0026rsquo;t get a lot done in the end.\nTruth is, humility is not thinking low of yourself. It\u0026rsquo;s about knowing your limits and struggles. It\u0026rsquo;s more about seeing what you can get done and making it better over time, instead of trying to do the best one from the get-go. Is about doing what you can with what you got, and then making it better slowly.\n\u0026hellip;I hope this post was good enough.\nPhoto by Ilia Zolas on Unsplash\nRelated links Mark Manson \u0026ndash; How to Get Over Perfectionism Ashraf Guitouni \u0026ndash; Entropy and Good Enough Software Ed Yourdon \u0026ndash; When good enough software is best Edsger W.
