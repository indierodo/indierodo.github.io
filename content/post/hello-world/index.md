Eight million people and one, if you count that time I read it on "The Pragmatic Programmer". Eight million and two, when I read it in "The Humble Programmer". But here I am, "The Perfectionist Programmer", thinking good-enough software sucks, and perfect software does exist somewhere in the universe, and even worse, I'll be the one to write it.

I fell in love with programming in the early 2010s, typing away simple programs that would compile on the first try (after all, I was copying them from the book), and I believed the rest of my journey as a developer would be filled with joy.

I learned alone that programming was logical and pure, and that every problem had a straightforward perfect solution.

So then, filled with confidence, after having studied for so long, I start coding my newest invention. I fill it with cool features and embrace the task with the mastery of years of programming... and after the first strike of motivation passes... Turns out I cannot get it done.

It's not a lack of ability or a lack of time. Rather, it's a lack of self-awareness that cause me to fail to deliver this project, to date.

Turns out I flew too close to the sun with this one. My vision was too ambitious. I didn't approach the task with humility and tried to create the most perfect, amazing thing I had ever done.

I ended up building the application three times, with different technologies. I rewrote the Software Requirements Sheet, prototyped over and over, burnt out, and didn't get a lot done in the end.

Truth is, humility is not thinking low of yourself. It's about knowing your limits and struggles. It's more about seeing what you can get done and making it better over time, instead of trying to do the best one from the get-go. Is about doing what you can with what you got, and then making it better slowly.

...I hope this post was good enough.
